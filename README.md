# Regression problem on the insurance data set.
The objective is to predict the most accurate estimate of a customer's lifetime value, which is a key metric in determining their long-term profitability. To achieve this, feature selection methods should be applied to identify the most influential variables that impact CLTV. This process involves examining a range of potential features, evaluating their relevance, and selecting the most informative ones.

Once the relevant features have been determined, regression modeling techniques, particularly the gradient boost algorithm, can be utilized to build a predictive model. Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak predictive models to create a stronger and more accurate model. By iteratively optimizing the model's performance through the minimization of errors, gradient boost enhances the precision of CLTV predictions.

The ultimate goal is to obtain the highest R2 score possible, which indicates the proportion of the variance in CLTV that can be explained by the model. A high R2 score signifies a better fit between the predicted and actual CLTV values, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and profitability.
